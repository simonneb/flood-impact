# Team Sensor Sensibility - Project Groundtruth

## Problem statement
How do we know if our high uncertainty warnings for hard to reach communities are accurate?

## Solution
We ask local residents to provide feedback via an online form on observed impacts. This allows us to understand what happens and how this relates to sensor behaviour and weather forecasts, and helps us refine our local flood warning offering based on actual on-the-ground observations.

This prototype provides an example of how local residents and communitys could feedback local impacts of flooding.

## Limitations
This prototype is a demonstration only - and has limited funcitonality. Only key routes have been designed due to time constraints.
